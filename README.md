# TreeMenu
Tree menu in VanillaJS.

JS skills test problem.

The goal is to make tree structure like this:

![Tree structure example](https://www.laserfiche.com/support/webhelp/webaccess/9.0/en-us/WA/Content/Images/Folder%20pane.png)

The number of subfolders is unlimited in general.
Also, it has to work right after inserting the script (should work everywhere).
I assume, that there is a container div.
Example JSON data format is provided.
